# Surf School Website

This is a HTML & CSS website based on [this](https://www.framer.com/marketplace/templates/surfing/) Framer website design by [Shahrukh Qureshi](https://www.framer.com/@shahrukhqureshi/). I thought this would be a good way to practice my HTML & CSS skills.

## Purpose

This is my second self-directed project. I have learned a lot about HTML & CSS since my first project. I wanted to complete a project that tested my skills and required a lot of "Googling" on my part.

My intentions when creating this website were to practice and/or become more comfortable with:

- Flexbox and grid
- Semantic HTML
- Transforms, transitions, and animations
- The different units in CSS
- CSS positioning
- Pseudo-elements & pseudo-classes
- Media queries

And to:

- Learn about things I haven't come across yet

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML & CSS
